Hey Ya'll - Did You Check In???


Our application is designed for teachers who need a better way to check in their students to class.
The application allows for the teacher to start a timer in between class periods and then the students have to check in within a specified amount of time.
If the students are on time they are marked present, if they are late they are marked tardy, and if they don't show up to class to check in they are marked absent.

Bootstrap, JQuery and Moment.js were used in the making of this application.
