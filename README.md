Hey Ya'll - Did You Check In???

Our application is designed for teachers who need a better way to check in their students to class. The application allows for the teacher to start a timer in between class periods and then the students have to check in within a specified amount of time. If the students are on time they are marked present, if they are late they are marked tardy, and if they don't show up to class to check in they are marked absent. The application also tells the gender of the student that checked in to study if boys or girls are more late to class and will also compare absences and tardies among boys and girls.

As a Teacher I want to keep track of students attendance. So That prense and class performance will be improved. Given that I am a certified teacher, When I have my students check in, Then I can check presence and absences in my class.
